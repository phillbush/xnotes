NAME
       xnotes - some notes on Xlib programming

DESCRIPTION
       This is a collection of programs and notes I wrote back when I was
       learning how to program X11 clients, and some notes I am adding to help
       people who are learning how to program using the Xlib library.  You can
       use these notes to help your learning, but don't use them as the only
       sources.  I recomment you to use Guy Keren's tutorial and Adrian Nye's
       book (and the man pages, of course).

       Each directory contains a program that teaches a lesson.  Begin with
       xhello, as it is teaches the basics of Xlib programming.  All lessons
       are introductions; you must refer to the manuals, when available.

       When you're in a directory, first compile and run the program, for you
       to understand how it works.  Then read the source code and try to grasp
       its structure.  Then read its README along with the code to understand
       the main concepts applied in the code and how stuff are implemented.

BUGS
       Some paragraphs were copied as is from other sources when I was
       learning how to program using Xlib.  I need to fix that.
