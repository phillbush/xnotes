NAME
       xnotes - some notes on Xlib programming

DESCRIPTION
       This is a collection of programs and notes I wrote back when I was
       learning how to program X11 clients, and some notes I am adding to help
       people who is learning how to program using the Xlib library.  You can
       use these notes to help your learning, but don't use them as the only
       sources.  I recomment you to use Guy Keren's tutorial and Adrian Nye's
       book (and the man pages, of course).

       Each directory contains a program that teaches a lession.  Begin with
       xhello, as it is teaches the basics of Xlib programming.  All lessons
       are introductions;  this means that to fully learn their subject, you
       must refer to the manuals.

       When you're in a directory, first compile and run the program, for you
       to understand how it works.  Then read the source code and try to grasp
       its structure.  Then read the CONCEPTS section of the readme along with
       the code to understand the main concepts applied in the code and how
       stuff are implemented.

       Some paragraphs were copied as is from other sources when I was
       learning how to program using Xlib.  I need to fix that.
